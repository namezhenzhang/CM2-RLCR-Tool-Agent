Hmm, maybe the function requires a numeric team ID instead of the name. Let me check the tool's parameters again.\n\nThe tool's description says the teamid can be the official name, abbreviation, or API-specific identifier. Wait, the example given was 'team_3456', which is a string with an underscore. The error message says it expected an integer but got a string. Oh, maybe the actual API expects a numeric ID, not a string. But the tool's parameters in the JSON have teamid as a string type. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, the tool's parameters specify teamid as a string, but the error says it should be an integer. That might be a mistake in the tool's setup. But as an assistant, I have to work with what's given. Maybe the correct teamid is a number, so I need to find the correct numeric ID for Washington Huskies. But how? The user didn't provide it. Should I ask them for the correct team ID, or try to find it using another method?\n\nWait, the tool's parameters allow teamid to be a string, like the name. But the error says it should be an integer. That's a problem. Maybe the function is misconfigured. But since I can't change the tool, I need to adjust. If the teamid needs to be an integer, but the user only provided the name, I can't proceed without more info. So I should inform the user that there was an error and ask for the team's numeric ID or check if they have that information. Alternatively, suggest that maybe the team ID is a number they can provide. But since the user might not know, I should explain the issue and ask for the correct team ID.\n</think>\n\nIt looks like there was an issue with the team identifier format. The system expects a numeric team ID, but I only have the team name (\"Washington Huskies\") from your request. To proceed, I'll need the specific numeric ID associated with the Washington Huskies football team. Could you provide this information?

They mentioned they don't know it offhand, so they need help locating it. The previous attempt used \"Washington Huskies\" as the teamid, but the system expected an integer, leading to an error.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to get the team ID. The available tool is get_the_last_games_of_a_football_team, which requires a teamid. But since the user doesn't have the ID, I can't use the existing tool to find it. The tool's description says the teamid can be the official name, abbreviation, or API-specific ID. However, in the first call, using the name resulted in an error expecting an integer. That suggests that the API might require a numeric ID rather than a string. \n\nWait, maybe the tool's parameters were described incorrectly. The parameters say teamid is a string, but the error says it expected an integer. That's conflicting. Maybe the tool actually requires a numeric ID, but the documentation is wrong. Or perhaps there was a mistake in the tool's setup. \n\nSince the user can't use other tools and the available tool isn't working with the team name, the next step is to inform the user that the existing tool isn't functioning as expected. The user needs guidance on how to find the correct ID. But how? Without access to another tool to search for team IDs, I can't retrieve it. The user might need to look up the team ID from a different source or provide more details. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the team name should work, but there was a different error. But the system's response was clear: expected integer, got string. So the API behind the tool requires a numeric ID. The user doesn't have that, so they need to find it. Since I can't access external resources, I should advise the user to check official NCAA or Washington Huskies' websites for the team ID. Alternatively, suggest possible common IDs if possible, but I might not have that information. \n\nThe response should be helpful but honest. Let the user know the issue, explain that the tool needs the numeric ID, and guide them on where to find it. Also, apologize for the inconvenience and offer further help once they have the ID.\n</think>\n\nI appreciate your patience! It seems we need to clarify the correct team ID format first. While I expected a numeric ID, it looks like this tool might require a different approach. Unfortunately, I don't have access to a team ID lookup function at the moment. \n\nTo resolve this, you could check the official Washington Huskies athletics website or the NCAA's football database for their team profile - these sources typically list the official numeric ID used in sports APIs. Would you like me to wait while you look that up, or would you prefer me to suggest alternative ways to find this information?",

Here’s how to locate the Washington Huskies' numeric team ID: 1. **Visit the official Washington Huskies athletics website** ([www.gohuskies.com](https://www.gohuskies.com)). 2. Navigate to the **Football** section under \"Sports\" or \"Teams.\" 3. Look for a **\"Schedule\"** or **\"Roster\"** page—team IDs often appear in the URL (e.g., `team/1234/washington`) or in the page’s metadata. 4. If unsure, check the **NCAA’s Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) directory** ([ncaa.org](https://www.ncaa.org)) and search for \"Washington Huskies\" to find their assigned ID. Would you like me to wait while you try this? Alternatively, if you’d prefer, I can walk you through an example using a different team’s ID to show how the tool works, and we can return to this later!",

They tried the initial step, but there was an error because the tool expected a numeric ID instead of the team name. Now, they're asking for help to find that ID.\n\nFirst, I need to guide them to the correct resources. The user provided steps to find the ID via the official website and the NCAA directory. But maybe there's a more straightforward way. Let me think—some sports APIs or websites list team IDs publicly. For example, the NCAA's website might have a search feature where you can input the team name and get the ID. Alternatively, maybe the user can check the team's Wikipedia page or other sports databases like ESPN, which sometimes include team IDs in their URLs or data.\n\nWait, the user already suggested visiting gohuskies.com and the NCAA site. Maybe I should confirm if those steps are accurate. Let me check: On the official site, navigating to the football schedule, the URL might have something like /football/schedule, but does it include the team ID there? Alternatively, looking at the page's source code might reveal the ID in the metadata. That's a common practice. The user might need to view the page source and search for \"team ID\" or similar terms.\n\nAlternatively, the NCAA's website (ncaa.org) might have a directory where you can search for teams by name and get their ID. That would be more direct. The user might not know how to navigate this, so providing a direct link could help, but since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on instructing them to check those pages.\n\nAnother angle: The user mentioned they used to attend games with their students. Maybe they have an alumni connection or can reach out to someone for the ID. But that's not efficient. The best bet is to guide them through the NCAA or official team site steps.\n\nWait, the error message said \"Expected integer, got string.\" So the tool requires a numeric ID, not a name. Since the user doesn't know the ID, my previous response was correct in directing them to find it. But perhaps I should also mention that sometimes the team ID can be found in the API endpoints of the NCAA or other sports data providers. For example, the NCAA's API might have endpoints where you can search by team name and get the ID.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use another function to find the ID, but according to the tools provided, there isn't a search function available. So the only tool is get_the_last_games_of_a_football_team, which requires the teamid. Therefore, the user must find the ID through external means.\n\nI should make sure the user knows that once they have the ID, I can proceed. Maybe offer to wait while they look it up. Also, reassure them that it's okay if they can't find it and offer alternative ways to get the information, like checking sports news sites for recent games, but since the tool is the only way, that's not possible.\n\nIn summary, the best approach is to thank them for their detailed steps, confirm that those are the correct methods, and offer to wait while they retrieve the ID. If they need more help, maybe suggest specific pages on the NCAA site where they can find the ID.\n</think>\n\nThank you for your thoughtful guidance! I'll wait while you or the user locate the team ID using these steps. Since the tool requires a numeric ID rather than a team name, this is the critical missing piece. Once we have it, I can retrieve the detailed match history, defensive stats, and recent performance metrics you're interested in. Let me know when you have the ID, or if you'd like me to suggest alternative ways to cross-reference this information!",
